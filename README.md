This app is an weather app created with create-react-app and typescript.
The app is also deployed to github pages at: https://marcusalfredsson.github.io/weather-app.
The app uses open weather api as weather source.

## To run the app
If you want to test the app yourself, you need to go over to open weather api and get an api key from them. Dont worry its free if you only use it for development. So after you get the api key, add that to the Api.ts file and then you are good to go.

## E2E tests
If you want to try the E2E tests, after you fix the api key run npm cypress:open, which will run the E2E tests in their dashboard.
